## Why did we make Scoot?

Inspired by many mini bots that the team and it's mentors have interacted with over the years, Scooter was developed for team 6762 as a minimal entry point to explore the feasibility of a swerve drive for a robotics in-season bot.

## What is Scoot?

Scooter is a robot with a 3d printed base that uses at least 2 of Rev's swerve modules and a full FRC control system. This way, the team can experiment with many season-allowed swerve libraries. This also allows a team to purchase only two modules versus the 4 a typical swerve bot has.

## Why only 2?

Since swerve is expensive. This solution allows a team to dip their toes in the waters of swerve relatively inexpensively.

## How much will this cost?

We do not have a full BOM yet, but the general estimate is below.

### The price of each swerve module, motors and controllers...

Number | Item             | Price | Desciption 
-------|------------------|-------|------------
1      |Rev Swerve Module |305.00 |this comes with the Rev Through Bore Encoder We purchased the plastic ones for testing, and the aluminum for competition. There is a known issue with the v1 plastic wheels. 
1 |Neo (no pinion) |52.00|	
1 |Neo 550 (no pinion) |29.50|	
2 |Spark Max| 92.00|	
  |Total   | 570.50

  
### Total General Cost


Number| Item| approximate cost of the number listed
-------|------------------|-------
1| 1Full FRC Control System: Radio, PDP/PDH, POE for Radio, Rio 1 or 2, RSL, | ~950
1| Optional: We substituted the [Rev POE cable](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-1210/) for the Rev Power Module. This is not tournament legal, but is working for us.|11.99
1| Optional: Small PDP. We used [this one from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B5TTTPM2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)| 19.99
1| Optional: 12Ohm terminating resistor. If you substitute the PDP, you need a terminating resistor for the Can Bus.| .15 at Digikey, 5:00/3 at Amazon
 |18 Gauge cable for the RSL| 11.99
 |12 Guage cable for all motor and power connections| 12.98
 |22 Guage cable for the rio and CAN | 10.48
 |cable connectors We used Anderson for the battery and Wago for all other power connectors molex/ dupont for CAN |
2 |swerve modules | 1141
  |Ring or hook Connectors for our PDP| 14.99 
  |~801.81 g |3d Fillament| 19.99
  |Fasteners for control system (we used velcro)| 7-20 depending on the brand and length
 4 |#10 bolts for the swerve modules and securing the base| 5.00
1 |Limelight or other targeting camera, Optional| 200 - 400
1 |battery| We use one of the [Studica batteries](https://www.studica.com/studica-robotics/12v-3000-mah-nimh-battery-pack-pp45)|44.99
 | Total| ~24445.55

 That sounds like a lot, however, other than the swerve drives themselves, we were able to source all of the materials from team stock. So, for us, it cost us clocer to $650.00. Many of the materials are also reuseable. Another aspect of the design is that you could use scoot as the control board for a full-size bot with four swerve modules.
