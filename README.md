# Scoot: The Kitten Bot

===============================================

## Why did we make Scoot?

Inspired by many mini bots that the team and it's mentors have interacted with over the years, Scooter was developed for team 6762 as a minimal entry point to explore the feasibility of a swerve drive for a robotics in-season bot.

## What is Scoot?

Scooter is a robot with a 3d printed base that uses at least 2 of Rev's swerve modules and a full FRC control system. This way, the team can experiment with many season-allowed swerve libraries. This also allows a team to purchase only two modules versus the 4 a typical swerve bot has.

## Why only 2?

Since swerve is expensive. This solution allows a team to dip their toes in the waters of swerve relatively inexpensively.

## How much will this cost?

We do not have a full BOM yet, but the general estimate is below.

Number | description| price | notes
1| 
Number | Item             | Price | Desciption 
-------|------------------|-------|------------
1      |Rev Swerve Module |305.00 |this comes with the Rev Through Bore Encoder We purchased the plastic ones for testing, and the aluminum for competition. There is a known issue with the v1 plastic wheels. 
1 |Neo (no pinion) |52.00|	
1 |Neo 550 (no pinion) |29.50|	
2 |Spark Max| 92.00|	| 1000| 


Cables
Full FRC Control System (we swapped the PDP/PDH for this one on Amazon. It is smaller and cheaper, but ring/spade terminals are annoying)
3d Fillament ~801.81 g
Fasteners (we used velcro)
